## Reflection

A friend in the music business has aspirations to build a bigger business and bring in more musicians for help during the summer. I build this website to help him gain a web presents and also to help communication between his clients.<br />

Originally, this website submission form data was being saved to firebase realtime database. The owner push back at this idea of always having to go into his google firebase account to retreive his website submission. This pushed me to spend time researching solutions on how he could receive website submissions in an easier way. <br />

I found a solution with Node Mailer. Website submission can be sent to the owner through one of his desired emails. A few hurdles I had to overcome was learning how to use Gmail with Nodemailer and also hosting a fullstack website with Heroku. <br /><br />


## Installation and Setup Instructions


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about running tests for more information.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`


Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!<br />

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at<br /> any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.<br /><br />

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies<br /> (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over <br />them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the<br /> copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.<br /><br />

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and<br /> middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we<br /> understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when<br /> you are ready for it.<br /><br />
